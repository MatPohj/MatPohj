# Hello stranger 
Hello! I'm Matti Pohjanoksa, an IT student from Haaga-helia.
I'm interested in Cybersecurity.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:🔭
* [Application hacking](https://github.com/MatPohj/Application-Hacking)
  

## ✅Some project's / Courses I've "finished" ✅
> * Nothing is never truly finished...
* [Personal website](https://matpohj.fi/)
* [Penetration testing course](https://github.com/MatPohj/PenetrationTesting25S)
  * Learned a lot about pentesting and how to document stuff. Used tools like: nmap, foxyproxy/zap, sliver, hashcat/john, fuzzy and metasploit & metasploitable.
* [Network attacks and reconnaissance](https://github.com/MatPohj/Network-Attacks-and-Reconnaissance-Autumn-25)
  * Learned a lot about RFID/NFC, Wireshark and WiFi pentesting.
* [Course project for my Back end course.](https://github.com/MatPohj/Raspi-2FA-Backend-Course-Project) A Spring Boot web app using Spring Security for login, enhanced with a custom NFC 2FA flow involving a Raspberry Pi with a RFID reader module and Python script for admin users. It also includes a CRUD feature for managing personal game statistics, persisted using Spring Data JPA and presented with Thymeleaf. Also pushed it to Heroku and connected it to a PostreSQL database.

  
## 🍇Some stuff I've made using Raspberry Pi 🍇

* SambaDB for easier file transfer across devices within the same network.
* Own VPN to acces my homenetwork remotely using PiVPN, Wireguard and DuckDNS.
* A "Bad USB" with raspberry pi pico, which runs as a HID-device. With it you are able to act as a keyboard. Some payloads I've made:
  - A payload which sets the volume to 100% and opens up a specific video.
  - A script which opens up powershell and runs a script collecting the user's wifi's and then getting the passwords for them. In the payload you can either choose to save them into the pico or print them out in the CLI.
