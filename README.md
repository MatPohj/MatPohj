## Hello stranger 
Hello! I'm Matti Pohjanoksa, an IT student from Haaga-helia.
Currently I'm mostly interested in learning Full-stack development, Cloud services (mostly AWS for now) and Cybersecurity

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:🔭
* [Course project for my Back end course.](https://github.com/MatPohj/Raspi-2FA-Backend-Course-Project) Making a basic Spring boot application with DB and account management etc so you can sign in. Spicing it up with Raspberry-Pi two factor authentication via it's RFC522 NFC Reader. 
* Course project for my Front end course.

### ✅Some project's I've "finished" ✅
> * Nothing is never truly finished... 
* [Coin cather game with Pygame](https://github.com/MatPohj/coin-catcher-pygame). Fun project I made for the Helsinki University's [MOOC Advanced Course in Programming](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/)
* [My first website using basic HTML and CSS.](https://matpohj.github.io/Legendojen_akatemia/) It's accessible via phone & computer
  
### 🍇Some stuff I've made using Raspberry Pi 🍇

* SambaDB for easier file transfer across devices within the same network.
* Own VPN to acces my homenetwork remotely using PiVPN, Wireguard and DuckDNS.
* A "Bad USB" with raspberry pi pico, which runs as a HID-device. With it you are able to act as a keyboard. Some payloads I've made:
  - A payload which sets the volume to 100% and opens up a specific video. [Here is the demo for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)
  - A script which opens up powershell and runs a script collecting the user's wifi's and then getting the passwords for them. In the payload you can either choose to save them into the pico or get print them out in the CLI. No video demo for this one.
* Currently working on making a Github repo, where I'll share my journey with Raspberry Pi and all the project's I've made.
